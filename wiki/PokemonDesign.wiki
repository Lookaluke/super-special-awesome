#summary How to make pokemon sprites
#labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

This is where you can find most of the information regarding sprite creation

= Type =

Our Pokemon game will be based on red/blue/yellow for pokemon types and battle calculations, and possibly moves. This means that there will be no steel/dark type pokemon. Also, no evolution stones will be used in this game.

= Size =

Both front and back sprites should be 80x80 pixels in size. An icon would also be helpful, size 32x32 2-frame animation. Save the two frames as two files, instead of one .gif animation.

= Naming Conventions =

Name it whatever you want, but just remember that it is not followed by the prefix -mon. That's DIGIMON not POKEMON.

= Giving us the sprites =

All images are preferably in .png format, but .bmp is acceptable and .gif is tolerable, but highly advised against (.jpg, .png, and other compressed or proprietary formats will not be accepted). Create a zip file called `PokemonName`.zip where `PokemonName` is the name of your pokemon. Put the sprites in named `front`, `back`, `icon1`, and `icon2`. Also include a text file called `info.txt` which includes pokemon type(s) (up to two are allowed), suggested move set (based on pokemon red/blue moves), suggested new moves, if any, suggested stats, and a pokedex entry (description, type e.g. `mouse`, height, weight).

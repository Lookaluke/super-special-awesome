#summary How to make pokemon sprites
#labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

This is where you can find most of the information regarding sprite creation

= Type =

Our Pokemon game will be based on red/blue/yellow for pokemon types and battle calculations, and possibly moves. This means that there will be no steel/dark type pokemon. Also, we are not planing to use evolution stones. (Its at the very bottom of the list of things to do.)

= Size =

Both front and back sprites should be 80x80 pixels in size. An icon would also be helpful, size 32x32 2-frame animation. Save the two frames as two files, instead of one .gif animation.

= Naming Conventions =

Name it whatever you want, but just remember that it is not followed by the prefix -mon. That's DIGIMON not POKEMON.

= Giving us the sprites =

All images are preferably in .png format, but .bmp is acceptable. NO OTHER FORMATS WILL BE ACCEPTED. Mark is currently working on a program that creates the necessary files. It may or may not zip them together...but if it doesn't then put all the files into a zip file and send that to us.

= Questions/Concerns =

If you're not sure what to do, email Kunal or Mark at their emails specified on the forum.

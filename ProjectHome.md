For a project in school. This is not meant as a copyright infringement, but rather a tribute to the great pokemon games. We will in no way sell this to anybody, and if you find out someone has, notify somebody. Also, its worth like 50% of our fourth marking period grade, so if you want to send us a C&D, wait until July :D

## OFFICIAL PROJECT NAMING ##

The game is going to be called pokemon razzmatazz, named after the crayola crayon.
